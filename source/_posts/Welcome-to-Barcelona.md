A new city to the list!

![](cover.jpg)

I just released a new map poster for [TheMapCrafter](http://themapcrafter.tictail.com/product/barcelona-map-poster-bw-24x36) project! Since it's kind of a personal project (still), I always have a feeling of satisfaction when a new one is out! This also allows me to choose the city I want, and this one is a more based on my own story than the previous ones.  

I barely remember the first time I went to Barcelona, I think it was with my mom and my sister when I was something like 12 or 13. But I remember pretty well the second time, I was 26.  
It was Only two weeks after Patrycja (who is now my wife) and I started to date, and it was our first weekend just the two of us, as a couple! At the time, I was living in Toulouse (south of France) and she was living in Montpellier, 2h away. I picked her half-way, at the train station of Narbonne, and we headed south, to the Spanish border. We didn't have much plan, just to go to Cadaqu√©s, sleep in the car and keep driving to Barcelona to discover the city.  

At the time, we barely knew each other, improvisation could have resulted into the worst weekend ever -- not a good start when you see each other only during weekends. Luckily, it was the exact opposite, making spontaneity the key ingredient for a close-to-perfect weekend! Since then, we called it a **match**, for us and for Barcelona.

Within the last years, we came back several times to Catalonia, always with the same pleasure and eager to discover what's new in the narrow streets of Barcelona.
